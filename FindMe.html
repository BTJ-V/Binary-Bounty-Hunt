            Modern definitions of what it means to create intelligence are more specific. Francois Chollet, an AI researcher at Google and creator of the machine-learning software library Keras, has said intelligence is tied to a system's ability to adapt and improvise in a new environment, to generalise its knowledge and apply it to unfamiliar scenarios.

"Intelligence is the efficiency with which you acquire new skills at tasks you didn't previously prepare for," he said.

"Intelligence is not skill itself; it's not what you can do; it's how well and how efficiently you can learn new things."

It's a definition under which modern AI-powered systems, such as virtual assistants, would be characterised as having demonstrated 'narrow AI', the ability to generalise their training when carrying out a limited set of tasks, such as speech recognition or computer vision.

Typically, AI systems demonstrate at least some of the following behaviours associated with human intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem-solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.
            It is no longer adequate for businesses to deploy IT systems based on the highest return on investment or efficiency gains. IT infrastructures must now run with the smallest possible carbon footprint and the minimum environmental impact, to not only drive sustainability goals set out by enterprises but also meet consumer and government mandates for sustainable innovation.

            Most major markets across the Asia Pacific region have established net zero targets and laid out various initiatives to move toward those goals. 

            Singapore, for instance, has pledged to be more selective of the data centers it allows to be built on local shores. Its Green Plan 2030 paves a 10-year journey comprising several targets that can help achieve its goal of net zero emissions, including plans for solar energy to power 350,000 households a year.

            Meanwhile, Japan’s Green Growth Strategy outlines a path toward carbon neutrality with plans to push green growth across 14 sectors in the country, including renewable energy sources and technologies such as carbon recycling. India’s sustainability aspirations include cutting the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% and achieving 50% cumulative electric power capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.

            “The region’s increasing focus on sustainable operations and products has underscored the need for companies to reduce their carbon footprint, even as they adopt transformative technologies that require more IT resources,” says Andrew Underwood, field chief technology officer at Dell Technologies in Asia Pacific and Japan. “Machine learning and automation tools, for instance, require intense compute power. The shift toward cloud technologies and increased consumption of digital services have also pushed the need for more data centers.”
            At a very high level, artificial intelligence can be split into two broad types: 

            Narrow AI

            Narrow AI is what we see all around us in computers today -- intelligent systems that have been taught or have learned how to carry out specific tasks without being explicitly programmed how to do so.

            This type of machine intelligence is evident in the speech and language recognition of the Siri virtual assistant on the Apple iPhone, in the vision-recognition systems on self-driving cars, or in the recommendation engines that suggest products you might like based on what you bought in the past. Unlike humans, these systems can only learn or be taught how to do defined tasks, which is why they are called narrow AI.

            General AI

            General AI is very different and is the type of adaptable intellect found in humans, a flexible form of intelligence capable of learning how to carry out vastly different tasks, anything from haircutting to building spreadsheets or reasoning about a wide variety of topics based on its accumulated experience. 

            This is the sort of AI more commonly seen in movies, the likes of HAL in 2001 or Skynet in The Terminator, but which doesn't exist today – and AI experts are fiercely divided over how soon it will become a reality.
            A survey conducted among four groups of experts in 2012/13 by AI researchers Vincent C Müller and philosopher Nick Bostrom reported a 50% chance that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would be developed between 2040 and 2050, rising to 90% by 2075. The group went even further, predicting that so-called 'superintelligence' – which Bostrom defines as "any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest" -- was expected some 30 years after the achievement of AGI. 

            However, recent assessments by AI experts are more cautious. Pioneers in the

            field of modern AI research such as Geoffrey Hinton, Demis Hassabis and Yann LeCun say society is nowhere near developing AGI. Given the scepticism of leading lights in the field of modern AI and the very different nature of modern narrow AI systems to AGI, there is perhaps little basis to fears that a general artificial intelligence will disrupt society in the near future.

            That said, some AI experts believe such projections are wildly optimistic given our limited understanding of the human brain and believe that AGI is still centuries away.
            While modern narrow AI may be limited to performing specific tasks, within their specialisms, these systems are sometimes capable of superhuman performance, in some instances even demonstrating superior creativity, a trait often held up as intrinsically human.

            There have been too many breakthroughs to put together a definitive list, but some highlights include: 

            In 2009 Google showed its self-driving Toyota Prius could complete more than 10 journeys of 100 miles each, setting society on a path towards driverless vehicles.
            In 2011, the computer system IBM Watson made headlines worldwide when it won the US quiz show Jeopardy!, beating two of the best players the show had ever produced. To win the show, Watson used natural language processing and analytics on vast repositories of data that is processed to answer human-posed questions, often in a fraction of a second.
            In 2012, another breakthrough heralded AI's potential to tackle a multitude of new tasks previously thought of as too complex for any machine. That year, the AlexNet system decisively triumphed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. AlexNet's accuracy was such that it halved the error rate compared to rival systems in the image-recognition contest.
